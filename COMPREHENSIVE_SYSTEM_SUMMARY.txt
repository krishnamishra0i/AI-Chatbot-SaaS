===========================================================================
USAGE:
===========================================================================

API Endpoint: POST http://localhost:8000/api/chat

Example:
{
  "message": "what is deep learning",
  "language": "en",
  "use_knowledge_base": true
}

Response:
{
  "response": "Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers...",
  "language": "en",
  "used_knowledge_base": true,
  "sources": [{
    "method": "exact_match",
    "confidence": 0.99,
    "accuracy": "maximum",
    "quality": "excellent",
    "source": "comprehensive_answer_db"
  }]
}

===========================================================================
ANSWER DATABASE STRUCTURE:
===========================================================================

Each answer includes:
- Accurate, well-researched content
- Clear explanations with examples
- Relevant context and details
- Proper grammar and professional tone
- Topic-specific expertise

Quality Levels:
- minimum (confidence < 0.5): Fallback/contextual answers
- good (confidence 0.6): General answers with less specificity
- very_good (confidence 0.90): Partial matches with high accuracy
- excellent (confidence 0.95): Partial matches with full accuracy
- maximum (confidence 0.99): Exact matches with perfect accuracy

===========================================================================
CONFIDENCE SCORING SYSTEM:
===========================================================================

0.99 - Exact match (e.g., "what is ai" matches "what is ai" key)
0.95 - High-quality partial match
0.90 - Keyword match with good confidence
0.60 - Contextual fallback answer
0.50 - General fallback

Lower confidence = system falls back to LLM-based responses

===========================================================================
